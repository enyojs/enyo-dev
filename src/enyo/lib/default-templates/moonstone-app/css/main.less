    App-specific LESS/CSS would go here, but to make your application easier to
    maintain, you should try to minimize the use of custom CSS.

    Additionally, you can override any moonstone variables in this file. You
    can also control the theme and change it from dark to light if desired by
    adding the assignment:

    @moon-theme: 'light';
